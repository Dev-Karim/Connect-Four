ðŸŽ® Connect-4 â€” CMPS 241 Systems Programming Project

ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains our implementation of the classic Connect-4 game, developed as part of CMPS 241 (Systems Programming) at AUB.
The project is written in C and designed to run in the terminal using a clean, console-based interface.

Connect-4 is a two-player strategy game played on a 6Ã—7 grid. Players alternate turns dropping their discs into columns, and the first to connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid fills completely without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
